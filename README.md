# ruTorrent Flutter App
Made by Nicolas S Camara for Google Summer of Code application

## Proposal
One of the most used torrent clients in a Linux based system is rTorrent but unfortunately, it does not provide a clean user interface. ruTorrent, on the other hand, is a web interface that interacts with rTorrent and provides a better user experience while providing multiple features and plugins. Unfortunately, there are not many mobile apps/plugins that let the user control ruTorrent from a phone that has a great native interface. The proposal chosen is to create a mobile application using Flutter to provide users a clean cross-platform user interface that runs ruTorrent’s backend service. The app will let users control their torrents and it will implement most of ruTorrent’s functionality. The idea was taken from the CCExtractor website.
